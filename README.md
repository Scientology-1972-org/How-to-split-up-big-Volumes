# How-to-split-up-big-Volumes

## Purpose

The purpose is to split up a big volume (like Red Vols, OEC or Blue Vols) into the single references (DABs, HCOBs, Lectures, Books etc) into single files and give them the correct filenames, so that these will be found by file search.

Reason: in some volumes are hidden treasures: references which do not exist as single files. We want to make available these by date and title in the filename.

I have not solved that yet, but wrote down some ideas how to solve that. In attached doc.

Perhaps ofthers have better ideas or can contribute to this project.
